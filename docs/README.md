# Contractor Prequalification System Documentation

_Thank you for taking the time to read the documentation._

## What Does "Hire Ready" Mean?

Contractors are considered **Hire Ready** when they meet all of the following criteria:

1.  The contractor is a registered vendor with the City's Purchasing Division.

2.  The contractor is **approved by the City's Legal Department**.

3.  The contractor has satisfied all **health and safety requirements**.

4.  The contractor has an account in **good standing with WSIB**.

5.  The contractor has **current liability insurance** with a minimum amount of $2,000,000.

Contractors may not be hired to perform work for the City
unless they are considered **Hire Ready**.

## Where is _Contactor X_?

Read only users are only able to see contractors that have been approved
by City departments.  If a contractor is not available, it likely does not have approval
from one or more City departments.

## Where Can I Find Out More About the Application Process?

[The City's website](https://saultstemarie.ca/City-Hall/City-Departments/Corporate-Services/Finance/Purchasing/Vendors-List.aspx)
includes information for the general public
about how to be included on the Purchasing Division's Vendors List,
and the process to become a prequalified **Hire Ready** contractor.
